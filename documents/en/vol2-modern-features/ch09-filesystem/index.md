# Filesystem Library

Before `std::filesystem` arrived, the C++ standard library had almost no capability for file system operations—we could only rely on POSIX APIs or platform-specific functions. C++17's filesystem library finally filled this gap, providing cross-platform path manipulation, file operations, and directory traversal capabilities. In this chapter, we start with path manipulation, master creating, reading, updating, and deleting files and directories, and finally build a practical directory traversal and search tool.
