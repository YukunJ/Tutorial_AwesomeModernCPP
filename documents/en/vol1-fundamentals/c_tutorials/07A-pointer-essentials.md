# Pointer Basics: The World of Addresses

Pointers are arguably the most famous feature in C, and the one most likely to scare away newcomers. If you have a background in Python or Java, you might be used to thinking that "a variable is the object itself"—the variable holds the data directly. But in C, there is an extra key concept: every variable resides at a specific location in memory, and that location has a number (an address). Pointers are simply variables designed to store and manipulate these addresses.

To be honest, building an intuition for pointers does take some time at first. But don't be intimidated just yet—we won't touch complex topics like multi-level pointers or function pointers today. We are going to focus on one single idea: **a pointer is an address, and an address is a locker number**. Once you grasp this, you will have a solid foundation for all the advanced pointer-related features down the road.

> - [ ] Correctly declare and initialize pointer variables
> - [ ] Understand the inverse relationship between the address-of (`&`) and dereference (`*`) operators

## Environment Setup

We will run all the following experiments in this environment:

- Platform: Linux x86\_64 (WSL2 is also fine)
- Compiler: GCC 13+ or Clang 17+
- Compiler flags: `-Wall -Wextra -std=c17`

## Step 1 — Understanding What an "Address" Is

### The Storage Locker Model

Before diving into pointer syntax, let's build an intuition. You can think of program memory as a very long row of storage lockers. Each locker has a number (this is the **address**), and you can put things inside it (this is the **data**). When you declare a variable, the compiler allocates a few consecutive lockers for you, and the variable name is simply the label you put on those lockers.

```c
int value = 42;
```

This line of code does two things: it allocates four consecutive lockers in memory (because an `int` takes up 4 bytes) and places the value `42` inside them. `value` is the label you give to these four lockers, but the lockers themselves have a starting number—for example, `0x7ffd1234`. This number is the address.

A pointer is simply a variable dedicated to storing "locker numbers." A normal variable stores data (the contents of the locker), while a pointer stores an address (the number of the locker).

### Let's Verify — Looking at a Variable's Address

Let's write a minimal program to see what a variable's address actually looks like:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int value = 42;
    int other = 100;

    printf("value 的值:   %d\n", value);
    printf("value 的地址: %p\n", (void*)&value);
    printf("other 的地址: %p\n", (void*)&other);

    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c17 addr_demo.c -o addr_demo && ./addr_demo
```

Output (the addresses will be different each time you run this, which is normal):

```text
value 的值:   42
value 的地址: 0x7ffd3a2b1c4c
other 的地址: 0x7ffd3a2b1c48
```

`%p` is the format specifier for printing a pointer address, and `&value` takes the address of `value`. The addresses of the two variables are very close together (differing by only 4 bytes) because they are allocated contiguously on the stack. The addresses change every time you run the program due to the operating system's Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security mechanism, but this doesn't affect our understanding of the concepts.

## Step 2 — Declaring Your First Pointer

### Pointer Declaration Syntax

The syntax for declaring a pointer variable is `类型* 变量名`. The `*` next to the type indicates "this is a pointer to that type." We prefer a style where `*` is kept close to the type name, written as `int* p`, so you can see at a glance that "p is an int pointer."

```c
int value = 42;
int* ptr = &value;  // ptr 存储了 value 的地址
```

`&` is the address-of operator, which returns the memory address of its operand. `ptr` now holds the address of `value`, and we say "ptr points to value."

### Never Forget to Initialize

There is a very important habit to form here: **always initialize a pointer when you declare it**. An uninitialized pointer contains a random value—it might point to anywhere in memory. If you accidentally dereference an uninitialized pointer, the best-case scenario is reading garbage data, the worst-case is an immediate segmentation fault, and in more insidious cases, the program "looks fine" but its data has been silently corrupted.

```c
int* good_ptr = NULL;     // 好：明确表示"不指向任何东西"
int* bad_ptr;             // 危险：包含随机地址，解引用是未定义行为
```

> ⚠️ **Gotcha Warning**
> `int* p, q;` declares an `int*` and an `int`—not two pointers! `*` only modifies the variable name `p` immediately following it. To declare two pointers, you must write `int *p, *q;`. This is a classic trap in C declaration syntax.

Initializing an unused pointer to `NULL` is a good habit. `NULL` is a special pointer value that means "does not point to any valid memory address." Although dereferencing `NULL` will also cause a segmentation fault, at least this error is predictable and easy to debug—unlike a wild pointer, which can create Schrödinger's bugs.

## Step 3 — Mastering Addresses with `&` and `*`

### A Pair of Inverse Operations

`&` (address-of) and `*` (dereference) are a pair of inverse operators: `&` gets the address from a variable, and `*` gets the variable from the address.

```c
int value = 42;
int* ptr = &value;     // &value → 取得 value 的地址，赋给 ptr

printf("value 的地址: %p\n", (void*)ptr);    // 打印地址
printf("ptr 指向的值: %d\n", *ptr);          // *ptr → 解引用，得到 42
```

Dereferencing `*ptr` means "follow the address stored in ptr and fetch the value from that memory location." Since we can read, we can naturally write as well:

```c
*ptr = 100;
printf("value = %d\n", value);  // 输出 100——通过指针修改了原始变量
```

This is the power of pointers: as long as you hold an address, you can directly manipulate the data at that memory location, regardless of whether that memory is in the current function's stack frame, on the heap, or in a hardware register's memory-mapped region.

Let's verify this by chaining the above operations together:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int value = 42;
    int* ptr = &value;

    printf("初始: value = %d, *ptr = %d\n", value, *ptr);
    printf("地址: &value = %p, ptr = %p\n", (void*)&value, (void*)ptr);

    *ptr = 100;
    printf("修改后: value = %d, *ptr = %d\n", value, *ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text
初始: value = 42, *ptr = 42
地址: &value = 0x7ffd1234abcd, ptr = 0x7ffd1234abcd
修改后: value = 100, *ptr = 100
```

Great, the addresses of `ptr` and `&value` are exactly the same, and we successfully modified the value of `value` through `*ptr = 100`.

### The `*` Symbol Wears Two Hats

Something that often confuses beginners is that the `*` symbol wears two hats: in a declaration, it means "this is a pointer type," and in an expression, it means "dereference." These are two entirely different things, so don't mix them up.

- The `*` in `int* p = &x;` is part of the type declaration, telling the compiler "p is an int pointer"
- The `*` in `*p = 10;` is the dereference operator, meaning "follow p's address and write data there"

Even though they look identical, their meanings are completely different. The trick to telling them apart is looking at the context: if `*` appears after a type name and before a variable name, it's a declaration; if it appears before a variable name inside a statement, it's a dereference.

## Step 4 — Pointers Can Do Math, Too

### Stepping by Type Size

Pointers don't just store addresses; they also support a limited set of arithmetic operations. But the "addition and subtraction" here is not the same as integer arithmetic—pointer arithmetic steps by **the size of the pointed-to type**.

Think of it this way: you are standing in front of a row of storage lockers, each 40 centimeters wide. If you say "move forward 1 locker," you actually move 40 centimeters, not 1 centimeter. Pointer arithmetic works exactly like this "locker-based" movement—the compiler knows that each `int` takes up 4 bytes, so `p + 1` actually adds 4 to the address.

```c
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int* p = arr;     // p 指向 arr[0]

p++;              // p 现在指向 arr[1]
                 // 地址增加了 sizeof(int)，即 4 字节

int val = *(p + 2);  // p+2 跳过两个 int，指向 arr[3]，val = 40
```

`p + 2` does not add 2 to the address value; it adds `2 * sizeof(int)`. This design is incredibly elegant—it makes pointer arithmetic naturally align with array index offsets.

### Distance Between Pointers

Two pointers pointing to elements within the same array can be subtracted, and the result is the number of elements (the distance) between them, not the byte difference of their addresses:

```c
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int* start = &arr[1];
int* end   = &arr[4];

ptrdiff_t distance = end - start;   // 3，不是 12
```

`ptrdiff_t` is a type defined in `<stddef.h>` specifically for representing pointer distances.

> ⚠️ **Gotcha Warning**
> Pointer arithmetic is only meaningful when the pointers point into the same array (or the same contiguous block of allocated memory). Subtracting two completely unrelated pointers is undefined behavior. The compiler won't throw an error, but the result is unpredictable.

Let's verify the effects of pointer arithmetic:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stddef.h>

int main(void)
{
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int* p = arr;

    printf("arr[0] = %d, *p = %d\n", arr[0], *p);
    p++;
    printf("p++ 后: *p = %d (arr[1])\n", *p);
    printf("*(p+2) = %d (arr[3])\n", *(p + 2));

    int* start = &arr[1];
    int* end = &arr[4];
    printf("end - start = %td 个元素\n", end - start);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text
arr[0] = 10, *p = 10
p++ 后: *p = 20 (arr[1])
*(p+2) = 40 (arr[3])
end - start = 3 个元素
```

Everything works exactly as we expected.

## Bridging to C++

C++ makes two key improvements on top of C pointers. The first is the **reference**, where `int& r = value` is essentially a const pointer that the compiler automatically dereferences—it must be initialized at declaration, cannot be rebound once bound, and doesn't require writing `*` when used, making it syntactically identical to manipulating the original variable directly. References are much safer than pointers, and C++ prefers passing function parameters by reference.

The second is the **smart pointer**, where `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` use the RAII mechanism to automatically manage memory lifecycles—memory is automatically released when the pointer goes out of scope, fundamentally eliminating the memory leaks and dangling pointer problems caused by manual `free`. We will dive deep into these topics later; for now, you just need to know that the core philosophy of C++ is to "use the type system and object lifecycles for automatic management."

## Summary

Today we built a foundational understanding of pointers: a pointer is simply a variable that stores a memory address. `&` takes the address, `*` dereferences it, and they are a pair of inverse operations. Pointer arithmetic steps by the size of the pointed-to type, naturally adapting to array traversal. Pointers must be initialized (even if just to `NULL`), as uninitialized pointers are dangerous.

We have only learned the "foundation" of pointers so far. This raises the next question—what exactly is the relationship between arrays and pointers? How do we distinguish between `const int* p` and `int* const p`? What is the difference between a NULL pointer and a wild pointer? These are the questions we will tackle in the next article.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Addresses and Values

Write a program that declares three variables of different types (`int`, `double`, `char`), and prints their values, addresses, and `sizeof` results. Observe whether the gaps between the addresses match the sizes of their respective types.

### Exercise 2: Traversing an Array with Pointers

Use pointer arithmetic to traverse an `int` array and print all its elements. You must not use the `[]` operator; use only pointer addition, subtraction, and dereferencing:

```c
/// @brief 使用指针算术遍历并打印 int 数组
/// @param data 数组首元素地址
/// @param count 元素个数
void print_int_array(const int* data, size_t count);
```
