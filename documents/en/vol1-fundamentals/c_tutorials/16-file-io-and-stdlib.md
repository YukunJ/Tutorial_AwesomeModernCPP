title: File I/O and Standard Library Overview

# File I/O and Standard Library Overview

So far, every program we have written shares a common limitation—data lives entirely in memory and vanishes once the program ends. Real-world programs do not work this way: configurations are read from files, logs are written to files, and data is passed between programs. This is where file I/O comes in.

C's file operations are built on a concise yet powerful API—`fopen` to open, `fread`/`fwrite` to read and write, `fclose` to close, plus the `printf`/`scanf` family for formatted I/O. These functions have survived from the 1970s to this day. But they also carry the rough edges characteristic of that era—lack of type safety, error handling via global variables, and compilers turning a blind eye when format strings and arguments mismatch. C++ later repackaged this system with stream libraries, `std::filesystem`, and `std::format`, but understanding C's raw API remains foundational.

## Environment Setup

All code in this article has been verified under the following environment:

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+) / WSL2 / macOS
- **Compiler**: GCC 11+ (confirm the version via `gcc --version`)
- **Compiler flags**: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11` (enable warnings, specify C11 standard)
- **Verification**: All code can be compiled and run directly

## Step One — Getting Started with File Operations

### Opening and Closing Files

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE* fp = fopen("data.txt", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Failed to open data.txt");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    // ... 读写操作 ...
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```

> ⚠️ **Pitfall Warning**: **Always check if fopen returns NULL**. A missing file, insufficient permissions, or an incorrect path will cause the open to fail. If you use a NULL pointer without checking, the program will crash immediately—without any meaningful error message.

Mode string quick reference:

| Mode | Read | Write | When File Does Not Exist | When File Already Exists |
|------|------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `"r"`  | Yes | No | Fails | Reads from the beginning |
| `"w"`  | No | Yes | Creates a new file | **Clears existing content** |
| `"a"`  | No | Yes | Creates a new file | Appends to the end |
| `"r+"` | Yes | Yes | Fails | Reads and writes from the beginning |
| `"w+"` | Yes | Yes | Creates a new file | **Clears, then reads and writes** |
| `"a+"` | Yes | Yes | Creates a new file | Reads from the beginning, writes append to the end |

> ⚠️ **Pitfall Warning**: `"w"` and `"w+"` will **unconditionally clear** the contents of an existing file. If you meant to append content but used the `"w"` mode instead, congratulations—your file content instantly drops to zero, with no confirmation step. Always double-check the mode before using it.

### Reading and Writing Binary Data

```c
typedef struct {
    uint16_t id;
    float value;
    uint32_t timestamp;
} Record;

// 写入
size_t written = fwrite(records, sizeof(Record), count, fp);

// 读取
size_t count = fread(buffer, sizeof(Record), max_count, fp);
```

The return value is the number of **complete blocks** successfully processed, not the number of bytes. If the return value is less than the requested number of blocks, it means either the end of the file was reached or an error occurred.

### Moving the File Position and Getting the Size

`fseek` moves the position pointer, and `ftell` queries the current position. A practical pattern is to get the file size:

```c
long get_file_size(FILE* fp) {
    long original = ftell(fp);
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);
    long size = ftell(fp);
    fseek(fp, original, SEEK_SET);
    return size;
}
```

### Don't Use feof as a Loop Condition

`feof` only returns true **after** a read operation has already failed. The correct approach is to check the return value of the read function directly:

```c
int ch;
while ((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) {
    putchar(ch);
}
```

> ⚠️ **Pitfall Warning**: `fgetc` returns `int`, not `char`. If you use `char` to receive the return value, `EOF` (-1) will be truncated to a valid character value on some platforms, causing the loop to never end. This trap catches a new batch of beginners every year.

## Step Two — Mastering Formatted I/O

### The printf Family

`printf` outputs to stdout, `fprintf` outputs to a specified file, and `sprintf`/`snprintf` output to a string buffer. The return value is the actual number of characters output.

```c
char buf[64];
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s:%d", name, age);
```

A clever use of `snprintf` is to probe the required buffer size:

```c
int needed = snprintf(NULL, 0, "Result: %d items", item_count);
char* buf = malloc(needed + 1);
snprintf(buf, needed + 1, "Result: %d items", item_count);
```

### The scanf Family

`scanf` returns the **number of successfully matched fields**. `sscanf` is very convenient for parsing from strings:

```c
const char* input = "2024-01-15";
int year, month, day;
int count = sscanf(input, "%d-%d-%d", &year, &month, &day);
```

> ⚠️ **Pitfall Warning**: `scanf`'s `%s` does not check buffer sizes. The safe approach is to use `%Ns` to specify the maximum length, or switch to the `fgets` + `sscanf` combination.

### Common Format Specifiers

| Specifier | Type | Specifier | Type |
|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| `%d` | int | `%f` | double |
| `%u` | unsigned | `%s` | string |
| `%x` | hex | `%zu` | size_t |
| `%ld` | long | `%lld` | long long |
| `%p` | pointer | `%%` | literal % |

## Step Three — Understanding Text Mode vs. Binary Mode

On Windows, text mode automatically converts `\n` to `\r\n`, while binary mode does not perform this conversion. On Linux/macOS, there is almost no difference between the two. When handling binary data (images, struct dumps, protocol frames), always use `"rb"`/`"wb"`.

> ⚠️ **Pitfall Warning**: If you read a binary file in text mode on Windows, the read will terminate prematurely when it encounters a `0x1A` byte—because `0x1A` is treated as EOF in Windows text mode. This is a classic cross-platform trap.

## Step Four — Error Handling with errno

`errno` (`<errno.h>`) is a global error code variable. When a function executes successfully, it **does not** clear `errno`; it is only set when an error occurs. The correct approach is to check the return value first to confirm an error, and then read `errno`.

`perror` concatenates your provided string with the system error message and prints it:

```c
FILE* fp = fopen("nonexistent.txt", "r");
if (fp == NULL) {
    perror("fopen failed");
    // 输出：fopen failed: No such file or directory
}
```

`strerror` returns the string description corresponding to the error code, which is suitable for use in custom error messages.

## Step Five — Handling Command-Line Arguments

```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Program: %s\n", argv[0]);
    for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("  argv[%d] = %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

`argv[0]` is the program name, `argv[1]` through `argv[argc-1]` are the arguments, and `argv[argc]` is `NULL`.

## Standard Library Quick Reference

### `<stdlib.h>`: General Utilities

`atoi` is simple but lacks error detection, while `strtol` is safer (it can detect overflow and partial parsing). `qsort` performs quicksort, and `bsearch` performs binary search, both comparing via function pointers. The random quality of `rand`/`srand` pseudo-random numbers is relatively poor—good enough for basic use, but do not rely on them for security-related tasks.

### `<math.h>`: Math Functions

Trigonometric functions (sin/cos/tan), exponential and logarithmic functions (pow/sqrt/log/exp), rounding (ceil/floor/round), and absolute value (fabs). All have three versions: float (f suffix), double, and long double (l suffix).

> ⚠️ **Pitfall Warning**: Linking the math library on GCC/Linux requires the `-lm` option. If you forget to add this option, the compiler will report errors like `undefined reference to 'sin'`—the code itself is fine, it is just missing a linker option.

### `<ctype.h>`: Character Classification

`isalpha`/`isdigit`/`isspace`/`isalnum`/`isupper`/`islower` determine character categories, and `tolower`/`toupper` handle case conversion. The argument must be explicitly cast to `unsigned char` first; otherwise, negative values from a signed char will lead to undefined behavior.

### `<assert.h>`: Assertion Macro

```c
assert(arr != NULL);   // Debug: 条件为假时终止程序
```

Defining `NDEBUG` completely removes all asserts. Use this to catch programming errors, not to handle runtime errors.

### `<stddef.h>`: Fundamental Types

`size_t` (object size), `NULL` (null pointer), `offsetof` (struct offset), `ptrdiff_t` (pointer difference). `size_t` is unsigned, so watch out for underflow when iterating in reverse: `for (size_t i = count; i-- > 0; )` is the safe way to write it.

## C++ Connections

### Stream Libraries (iostream/fstream/sstream)

The C++ stream library achieves **type safety** through operator overloading—passing the wrong type directly causes a compilation failure. Destructors automatically close files (RAII). `std::getline` directly returns `std::string`, eliminating the risk of buffer overflows.

### std::filesystem (C++17)

Cross-platform directory traversal, file attribute queries, and path operations—no more need to write `#ifdef _WIN32`.

### std::format (C++20)

Combines the concise syntax of printf with type safety:

```cpp
std::string s = std::format("{} is {} years old", name, age);
```

### std::span (C++17)

`std::span<const int>` binds a pointer and a length together, solving the long-standing problem of arrays decaying and losing their length information.

### `<system_error>`

`std::error_code` is a value type and thread-safe, making it much safer than the global `errno`.

## Summary

The core of file operations is `FILE*` and `fopen`/`fclose`/`fread`/`fwrite`, formatted I/O relies on the `printf`/`scanf` family, and error handling depends on `errno` + `perror`. The standard library provides fundamental tools like numeric conversion, sorting and searching, math functions, character classification, and assertions. C++ delivers a comprehensive type-safe upgrade to these tools with stream libraries, `std::filesystem`, `std::format`, and `std::error_code`.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Configuration File Parser

Parse a configuration file in `key=value` format, ignoring `#` comments and blank lines.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define MAX_LINE 256
#define MAX_KEY 64
#define MAX_VALUE 128

typedef struct {
    char key[MAX_KEY];
    char value[MAX_VALUE];
} ConfigEntry;

/// @brief 去除字符串首尾的空白字符
char* trim(char* str);

/// @brief 解析配置文件
size_t parse_config(const char* path, ConfigEntry* entries, size_t max_entries);

/// @brief 在配置项中查找指定 key
const char* find_config(const ConfigEntry* entries, size_t count, const char* key);

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <config_file>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    // TODO: 调用 parse_config 和 find_config
    return 0;
}
```

Hint: Use `fgets` to read line by line, `strchr` to find the `=` position, and `trim` to strip whitespace.

### Exercise 2: File Copy Tool

Specify the source and destination files via command-line arguments, support binary file copying, and display progress.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define kBufferSize 4096

/// @brief 复制文件
int copy_file(const char* src_path, const char* dst_path)
{
    // TODO: 实现
    // 1. "rb" 打开源文件，"wb" 打开目标文件
    // 2. 循环 fread/fwrite
    // 3. 用 fseek/ftell 获取总大小，打印进度
    // 4. 错误处理：先打开的后关闭
    return -1;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // TODO: 解析命令行参数，调用 copy_file
    return 0;
}
```

Hint: Use `fseek` + `ftell` to get the source file size, and use `\r` to overwrite the same line to implement a progress bar.
