# Virtual Functions and Polymorphism

In the previous chapter, we covered single inheritance—a derived class inherits members from a base class and can extend them with new behaviors. But inheritance alone only solves half the problem: if we use a base class pointer to operate on a derived class object, we always end up calling the base class version of the function, which severely limits the expressiveness of inheritance. Virtual functions are the key to completing the other half—they make it possible to "call a derived class implementation through a base class interface," and this is runtime polymorphism.

Today, we are going to sit down and thoroughly understand this: what exactly `virtual` does, why `override` should always be written, how the vtable the compiler sets up behind the scenes works, and what kind of disaster forgetting to write a `virtual` destructor can bring.

## A World Without virtual — The "Nearsightedness" of Base Class Pointers

Let's face the problem head-on. Suppose we have a simple shape class hierarchy:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

class Shape {
public:
    void draw() const { printf("Shape::draw()\n"); }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const { printf("Circle::draw()\n"); }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const { printf("Rectangle::draw()\n"); }
};
```

Three classes, both `Circle` and `Rectangle` define their own `draw()`. This seems fine—but when we call through a base class pointer, things go wrong:

```cpp
int main() {
    Shape* shapes[3];
    shapes[0] = new Shape();
    shapes[1] = new Circle();
    shapes[2] = new Rectangle();

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        shapes[i]->draw();
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        delete shapes[i];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

You expect three different drawing behaviors, but the actual output is:

```text
Shape::draw()
Shape::draw()
Shape::draw()
```

All three are `Shape::draw()`. When compiling `shapes[i]->draw()`, the compiler only sees that the static type of `shapes[i]` is `Shape*`, so it dutifully binds to `Shape::draw()`. It has no idea, and doesn't care, whether this pointer actually points to a `Circle` or a `Rectangle` at runtime—this is **static binding** (also known as early binding). When we need "a unified interface with different behaviors," static binding is a stumbling block, and `virtual` is exactly the key to breaking it.

## The virtual Keyword — Making Function Calls "Wait Until Runtime"

Adding `virtual` in front of a base class member function changes everything:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const {   // 加上 virtual
        printf("Shape::draw()\n");
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {  // 隐式虚函数
        printf("Circle::draw()\n");
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        printf("Rectangle::draw()\n");
    }
};
```

We only need to add one `virtual` in front of `draw()` in the base class, and matching functions with the same signature in derived classes automatically become virtual as well. Now let's run the loop again:

The output becomes:

```text
Shape::draw()
Circle::draw()
Rectangle::draw()
```

Each object calls the corresponding version of `draw()` based on its **actual type**—this is **dynamic binding** (also known as late binding), which is **runtime polymorphism**. The core value of polymorphism is that the caller doesn't need to know the concrete type of the object, only "what this object can do." This ability to have "a unified interface with diverse behaviors" is the cornerstone of decoupling in object-oriented design.

## The override Keyword (C++11) — The "Seatbelt" the Compiler Watches For You

C++11 introduced the `override` keyword. It doesn't change any runtime behavior, but it is something you **must add** when writing virtual function overrides. The reason is simple: it forces the compiler to check whether you have truly and correctly overridden a base class virtual function.

Let's look at a classic pitfall scenario without `override`:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const { printf("Shape::draw()\n"); }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() {   // 忘了 const！签名不匹配，不是重写
        printf("Circle::draw()\n");
    }
};
```

Notice the signature of `Circle::draw()`—it's missing `const`. This differs from the signature of the base class's `virtual void draw() const`, so the compiler considers this a new ordinary member function belonging to `Circle` itself, completely unrelated to `Shape::draw()`. When calling `draw()` through a base class pointer, it goes through static binding and still calls `Shape::draw()`. The most terrifying part is: this code **compiles perfectly with no warnings at all**. The author has had their blood pressure spike over this more than once.

After adding `override`, the exact same problem is immediately caught by the compiler:

```cpp
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {   // 编译错误！签名不匹配
        printf("Circle::draw()\n");
    }
};
```

```text
error: 'void Circle::draw()' marked 'override', but does not override any base class virtual function
```

The compiler explicitly tells you: you claim to be overriding a base class virtual function, but the signatures don't match. Errors that `override` can catch include but are not limited to: the base class doesn't have a virtual function with that name at all, function signature mismatches (differences in `const`, reference qualifiers, etc.), and the base class function not being `virtual`. So the iron rule is—**whenever you are overriding a virtual function, always write `override`**.

> **Pitfall Warning**: Not adding `override` won't cause an error, but a wrong signature is a disaster. Make it a habit: add `override` to every virtual function override, treating it as a mandatory action like buckling a seatbelt.

## Demystifying vtable — The Springboard Behind Polymorphism

After understanding the effect of `virtual`, let's look at what the compiler does behind the scenes. For every class that contains virtual functions, the compiler generates a **virtual table** (vtable)—essentially an array of function pointers, where each entry corresponds to a virtual function and stores the address of **that class's** actual implementation of the virtual function.

Taking our shape class hierarchy as an example, the compiler roughly generates three vtables:

```text
Shape 的 vtable:     [ &Shape::draw ]
Circle 的 vtable:    [ &Circle::draw ]
Rectangle 的 vtable: [ &Rectangle::draw ]
```

And every object that contains virtual functions has an extra hidden member in its memory layout—the **virtual table pointer** (vptr), which points to the vtable of the object's class.

When you write `shapes[i]->draw()`, the code generated by the compiler roughly does the following: first finds the `vptr` through the object, locates the corresponding vtable, then retrieves the function pointer for `draw()` from the table, and finally makes an indirect call through this pointer:

```text
shapes[1] (Shape*)  ----->  Circle 对象
                            [ vptr ] -------> Circle 的 vtable: [ &Circle::draw ]
```

This is the entire overhead that a virtual function call adds compared to a normal function call—**one extra indirect jump**. On a PC, this overhead is almost negligible. But in resource-constrained embedded environments, we need to take it seriously: every class with virtual functions adds one vtable (occupying Flash), every object adds one `vptr` (usually 4 or 8 bytes, occupying RAM), and every virtual function call adds one indirect jump (which may affect the pipeline and branch prediction). Fortunately, in the vast majority of scenarios, these overheads are trivial compared to the "architectural benefits gained from decoupling."

> **Pitfall Warning**: On an MCU with only a few KB of RAM, adding one `vptr` per object can be fatal. If your system needs to create a large number of small objects (such as sensor sampling data points), carefully evaluate the memory overhead of polymorphism.

## Virtual Destructors — The Last Line of Defense for Polymorphism

There is a detail in the use of polymorphism that is often overlooked, but ignoring it leads to **undefined behavior**: when you intend to `delete` a derived class object through a base class pointer, the base class's destructor must be `virtual`.

Let's look at a negative example first:

```cpp
class BadBase {
public:
    ~BadBase() { printf("~BadBase()\n"); }   // 非虚析构
};

class BadDerived : public BadBase {
    int* data_;
public:
    BadDerived() : data_(new int[100]) {}
    ~BadDerived() { delete[] data_; printf("~BadDerived(): released\n"); }
};

BadBase* p = new BadDerived();
delete p;    // 只调用了 ~BadBase()，~BadDerived() 被跳过！
```

The output is only `~BadBase()`, and `~BadDerived()` is never called at all—the 400 bytes of memory corresponding to `data_` leak directly. The reason is the same as before: when `delete p` is called, the compiler sees that the static type of `p` is `BadBase*`, and since `~BadBase()` is not virtual, it statically binds to the base class's destructor, and the derived class's destruction logic is completely skipped.

The solution is very simple—add `virtual` to the base class destructor:

```cpp
class GoodBase {
public:
    virtual ~GoodBase() = default;   // 虚析构函数
};
```

Now execute the same operation again:

```cpp
GoodBase* p = new GoodDerived();
delete p;
// 输出：
// ~GoodDerived(): data_ released
// ~GoodBase()
```

The destruction order is correct: first `~GoodDerived()`, then `~GoodBase()`, and resources are fully released. Here we use `= default` because the base class destructor itself doesn't have any special cleanup work to do. The key is that `virtual`—it allows the `delete` operation to go through dynamic binding as well.

So there is an iron rule: **as long as a class has any virtual functions, its destructor must be declared `virtual`**. Conversely, if a class has no virtual functions and is not intended to be inherited from—then a non-virtual destructor is perfectly fine. But once you start designing with polymorphism, there is no room for ambiguity on this.

> **Pitfall Warning**: Non-virtual destructor + deleting a derived class object through a base class pointer = undefined behavior. In embedded systems, this usually manifests as "inexplicable memory leaks" or "abnormal peripheral states," and it is extremely difficult to track down. When you see virtual functions, immediately check whether the destructor is also virtual.

## Practical Exercise — A Polymorphic Shape System

Now let's tie together what we learned earlier and write a complete polymorphic shape system. This example shows how virtual functions work in actual code.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

// 抽象基类
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const = 0;           // 纯虚函数
    virtual double area() const = 0;         // 纯虚函数
    virtual ~Shape() = default;              // 虚析构函数

    const char* name() const { return name_; }

protected:
    const char* name_;   // 派生类在构造时设置
};

// 圆形
class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius_;

public:
    explicit Circle(double r) : radius_(r) { name_ = "Circle"; }

    void draw() const override {
        printf("  Drawing Circle (r=%.2f)\n", radius_);
    }

    double area() const override {
        return 3.14159265 * radius_ * radius_;
    }
};

// 矩形
class Rectangle : public Shape {
private:
    double width_;
    double height_;

public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width_(w), height_(h) { name_ = "Rectangle"; }

    void draw() const override {
        printf("  Drawing Rectangle (%.2f x %.2f)\n", width_, height_);
    }

    double area() const override {
        return width_ * height_;
    }
};

// 三角形
class Triangle : public Shape {
private:
    double base_;
    double height_;

public:
    Triangle(double b, double h) : base_(b), height_(h) { name_ = "Triangle"; }

    void draw() const override {
        printf("  Drawing Triangle (base=%.2f, height=%.2f)\n", base_, height_);
    }

    double area() const override {
        return 0.5 * base_ * height_;
    }
};
```

Notice the design of `Shape`: `draw()` and `area()` are pure virtual functions (`= 0`), meaning `Shape` itself cannot be instantiated, and any class that wants to be a "valid shape" must provide its own implementations. The destructor is declared `virtual ... = default`, ensuring polymorphic safety without needing to manually write cleanup logic. `name_` is placed in the `protected` section, allowing derived classes to set it in their constructors.

Then we create a group of different shapes in `main()` and operate on them with a unified interface:

```cpp
int main() {
    // 用基类指针的 vector 存储所有图形
    std::vector<Shape*> shapes;
    shapes.push_back(new Circle(3.0));
    shapes.push_back(new Rectangle(4.0, 5.0));
    shapes.push_back(new Triangle(6.0, 2.0));
    shapes.push_back(new Circle(1.5));

    printf("=== Drawing all shapes ===\n");
    for (auto* s : shapes) {
        s->draw();   // 多态：调用实际类型的 draw()
    }

    printf("\n=== Areas ===\n");
    double total = 0.0;
    for (auto* s : shapes) {
        double a = s->area();
        printf("  %-12s: %.4f\n", s->name(), a);
        total += a;
    }
    printf("  Total area: %.4f\n", total);

    // 清理——虚析构函数确保每个派生类正确释放
    for (auto* s : shapes) {
        delete s;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Running result:

```text
=== Drawing all shapes ===
  Drawing Circle (r=3.00)
  Drawing Rectangle (4.00 x 5.00)
  Drawing Triangle (base=6.00, height=2.00)
  Drawing Circle (r=1.50)

=== Areas ===
  Circle       : 28.2743
  Rectangle    : 20.0000
  Triangle     : 6.0000
  Circle       : 7.0686
  Total area: 61.3429
```

The entire loop relies only on the `Shape` interface, with no knowledge of what concrete types are in the container. In the future, if we want to add a `Pentagon` class, we just need to inherit from `Shape`, implement `draw()` and `area()`, and then put it into the container—**the main loop code doesn't need to change a single line**. This is the extensibility that polymorphism brings.

## Exercises

1. **Polymorphic Document Printing**: Design a document class hierarchy. The base class `Document` has a pure virtual function `void print() const` and a virtual destructor. Derive `TextDocument` (prints text content), `ImageDocument` (prints image description information), and `PdfDocument` (prints page count and author). In `main()`, create different types of documents, store them in a `vector<Document*>`, iterate and call `print()`, and verify that each type outputs its own content.

2. **Verify Virtual Destructors**: Building on exercise 1, add a `printf` output to each derived class's destructor. First, clean up normally (`delete` each pointer) and observe the destruction order. Then remove the `virtual` from the base class destructor and run it again to see what changes—you will witness firsthand the process of derived class destructors being skipped.

## Summary

In this chapter, we thoroughly broke down runtime polymorphism around virtual functions. Without `virtual`, a base class pointer can only statically bind to the base class's function implementation—this is the root cause for many beginners who write inheritance but find "polymorphism doesn't work." The `virtual` keyword turns function calls into dynamic binding, deciding which version to call based on the object's actual type. `override` is the seatbelt C++11 gave us—always add it after every virtual function override, and let the compiler check whether the signature truly matches. The virtual destructor is the safety baseline for using polymorphism; forgetting it means that when deleting a derived class object through a base class pointer `delete`, the derived class's destruction logic is skipped, resulting in resource leaks or undefined behavior.

At the underlying mechanism level, the compiler achieves all of this through vtables and vptrs: each class has one vtable storing function pointers, each object has one vptr pointing to its class's vtable, and a virtual function call is completed through this indirect springboard. The overhead is small, but in extremely resource-constrained embedded scenarios, we need to keep it in mind.

In the next chapter, we will move on to abstract classes and pure virtual functions—pushing polymorphism toward a more rigorous design level, using "capability contracts" to constrain what behaviors a derived class must provide.
