# Modern C++ for Embedded Systems — Lock-Free Data Structure Design

## Introduction

In the previous two chapters, we covered `std::atomic` and memory order, so you should now be comfortable with basic atomic operations. In real-world projects, however, simply knowing how to operate on atomic variables is far from enough — what you really need are thread-safe data structures: queues, stacks, hash tables, and the like.

The traditional approach is to wrap them with locks — simple, brute-force, but effective. The problem is that lock overhead is far from negligible: thread contention triggers kernel-mode scheduling, cache coherence protocols bombard the system, and in real-time systems, priority inversion can drive you crazy.

Lock-free data structures are carefully crafted alternatives built on atomic operations. Instead of relying on mutexes, they leverage low-level mechanisms like CAS (Compare-And-Swap), atomic pointers, and memory ordering to allow multiple threads to access data concurrently without blocking each other.

But frankly, lock-free programming is one of the most error-prone and difficult-to-debug areas in C++. The ABA problem, memory reclamation, false sharing... each one can keep you up late debugging. So our goal in this chapter is: understand the principles, know when to use them, and more importantly — know when **not** to use them.

> In a nutshell: **Lock-free data structures achieve thread safety through atomic operations, avoiding lock overhead but adding complexity. They are only suitable for high-concurrency, low-latency scenarios.**

------

## Understanding CAS Through a Lock-Free Stack

The lock-free stack is the simplest and most classic lock-free data structure, serving as the gateway to understanding the entire field. We will look at the implementation first, then gradually break down the pitfalls.

### Basic Structure: Nodes and Head Pointer

```cpp
template<typename T>
class LockFreeStack {
private:
    struct Node {
        T data;
        Node* next;
        explicit Node(const T& value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
    };

    std::atomic<Node*> head;

public:
    LockFreeStack() : head(nullptr) {}

    void push(const T& value);
    bool pop(T& value);
};

```

The structure is simple: a singly linked list with the head pointer wrapped in an atomic variable. All operations occur at the head, so we only need to synchronize a single pointer.

### The push Operation: Core Usage of CAS

```cpp
void push(const T& value) {
    Node* new_node = new Node(value);

    // 1. 读取当前头指针
    Node* old_head = head.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);

    while (true) {
        // 2. 新节点指向旧头
        new_node->next = old_head;

        // 3. 尝试更新头指针：如果head还是old_head，就设为new_node
        if (head.compare_exchange_weak(
                old_head,              // 预期值：如果是这个就成功
                new_node,              // 新值
                std::memory_order_release,  // 成功时的内存序
                std::memory_order_relaxed   // 失败时的内存序
            )) {
            break;  // CAS成功，退出循环
        }

        // CAS失败：old_head被自动更新为最新值，重试
    }
}

```

The essence of this code lies in the CAS loop. Let's break it down:

1. Read the current head pointer into `old_head`
2. Point the new node's `next` to `old_head`
3. CAS: if `head` is still `old_head`, set `head` to `new_node` and return true; otherwise, return false and update `old_head` to the current value

If the CAS fails, it means another thread modified `head` first, but `compare_exchange_weak` automatically updates `old_head` to the latest value, so we simply retry in a loop. This is the core of lock-free algorithms — optimistic concurrency: assume no conflict, and retry if a conflict occurs.

**Why use weak instead of strong?**

`compare_exchange_weak` allows "spurious failures" (it may return false even if the values are equal), but it is generally more efficient in a loop because certain hardware architectures (like ARM) implement the weak version with lower overhead. `compare_exchange_strong` guarantees no spurious failures but may require extra instructions. Using weak in loops and strong in non-loop scenarios is the standard recommendation.

### The pop Operation: Looks Simple, Full of Pitfalls

```cpp
bool pop(T& value) {
    Node* old_head = head.load(std::memory_order_acquire);

    while (old_head) {
        // 读取旧头的next
        Node* next_node = old_head->next;

        // 尝试把头指针移到下一个节点
        if (head.compare_exchange_weak(
                old_head,
                next_node,
                std::memory_order_release,
                std::memory_order_relaxed
            )) {
            value = old_head->data;
            // 这里有个大问题：什么时候释放old_head？
            return true;
        }

        // CAS失败，重新读取
        old_head = head.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
    }

    return false;  // 栈空
}

```

This implementation has a fatal flaw: **when do we free the memory pointed to by `old_head`?**

If we directly `delete old_head`, it might get freed while another thread is still accessing it — this is a classic use-after-free. But if we don't free it, we have a memory leak. This problem has trapped countless developers and remains one of the hardest parts of lock-free programming.

**Solutions**:

- **Deferred reclamation**: Put nodes to be freed into a linked list and periodically batch-clean them
- **Hazard Pointer**: A standardized approach coming in C++26 that lets threads declare "I am currently using this pointer"
- **RCU (Read-Copy-Update)**: Lock-free on the read side, deferred reclamation on the write side
- **Reference counting**: `std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<Node>>`, but with significant performance overhead

For embedded systems, if your stack depth is bounded, the simplest approach is to pre-allocate a node pool and manage it using the object pool pattern we covered in Chapter 5 — combined with lock-free algorithms, this avoids dynamic allocation entirely.

------

## Lock-Free Queues: Evolution from SPSC to MPMC

Queues are more commonly used in embedded systems than stacks — data transfer from interrupts to the main thread, task scheduling, and message passing all rely on them.

### SPSC Queues: Single Producer, Single Consumer

The Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) scenario is the simplest because there is only one writer and one reader, so we don't need to handle multiple threads writing or reading simultaneously.

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t Capacity>
class SPSCQueue {
public:
    SPSCQueue() : read_idx(0), write_idx(0) {
        // 预分配所有节点，避免运行时分配
    }

    bool push(const T& item) {
        const size_t current_write = write_idx.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
        const size_t next_write = (current_write + 1) % Capacity;

        // 检查队列是否满
        if (next_write == read_idx.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
            return false;
        }

        buffer[current_write] = item;
        write_idx.store(next_write, std::memory_order_release);
        return true;
    }

    bool pop(T& item) {
        const size_t current_read = read_idx.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);

        if (current_read == write_idx.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
            return false;
        }

        item = buffer[current_read];
        const size_t next_read = (current_read + 1) % Capacity;
        read_idx.store(next_read, std::memory_order_release);
        return true;
    }

private:
    std::array<T, Capacity> buffer;
    std::atomic<size_t> read_idx{0};   // 读指针
    std::atomic<size_t> write_idx{0};  // 写指针
};

```

**Key points**:

- Read and write pointers are separated, with only one writer and one reader
- `write_idx` is only modified by the producer, `read_idx` is only modified by the consumer
- `relaxed` is used for reading and writing a single index, `acquire/release` is used to synchronize empty/full states
- Pre-allocated array avoids memory allocation issues in lock-free environments

This is the most practical lock-free queue in embedded systems. Data transfer from a UART interrupt to the main loop, DMA buffer management, and similar tasks can all use this pattern.

### MPMC Queues: Multiple Producers, Multiple Consumers

Multiple Producers Multiple Consumers (MPMC) is much more complex, requiring us to handle multiple threads pushing or popping at the same time.

We will only cover the core ideas here — a full implementation is omitted for brevity, and frankly, in scenarios that truly need an MPMC lock-free queue, using a mature library (like Facebook's `folly::MPMCQueue` or Boost lock-free queues) is far more reliable than writing your own.

Core ideas:

1. **Linked list nodes + atomic pointers**: Each node has an atomic `next` pointer
2. **Separate head and tail pointers**: `head` for pop, `tail` for push
3. **CAS loops**: Use CAS retries when updating pointers

**Performance bottleneck**: When multiple threads compete for the same cache line, false sharing causes severe performance degradation. The solution is to use `alignas(64)` to place `head` and `tail` on different cache lines.

------

## The ABA Problem: The Number One Killer in Lock-Free Programming

The pop operation we discussed earlier has a hidden bug known as the ABA problem.

### What is the ABA Problem

Suppose we have a stack with two nodes: A → B

1. Thread 1 reads `head = A`, preparing to pop
2. Thread 2 pops A, now head = B
3. Thread 2 pushes a new node C, then pushes A back, now the stack is A → C → B
4. Thread 1 executes CAS: `head.compare_exchange(old_head=A, new_node=B)`
5. CAS succeeds! Because head is indeed A

But here is the problem: Thread 1 thinks head is still the same A it read originally, but in reality, A was popped and pushed back. It completely missed all the changes in between. Even worse, if A's memory was freed and reallocated to a different object, the CAS might incorrectly match.

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: Double-Word CAS

Many 64-bit architectures support 128-bit CAS operations, allowing us to compare and swap both the pointer and a version number simultaneously:

```cpp
struct StampedPtr {
    Node* ptr;
    uint64_t stamp;  // 版本号
};

std::atomic<StampedPtr> head;

// 每次修改都增加版本号
void push(Node* new_node) {
    StampedPtr old_head = head.load();
    StampedPtr new_head{new_node, old_head.stamp + 1};

    do {
        new_node->next = old_head.ptr;
    } while (!head.compare_exchange_weak(old_head, new_head));
}

```

This way, even if the pointer changes from A to B and back to A, the version number will have changed, and the CAS will fail.

#### Solution 2: Hazard Pointers (C++26)

Hazard Pointers provide a more general-purpose solution by letting threads declare "I am currently accessing this node," and the reclaimer checks for declared hazard pointers before freeing memory.

C++26 will standardize Hazard Pointers (`std::hazard_pointer`). For now, you can refer to Howard Hinnant's implementation or use third-party libraries.

#### Solution 3: Embedded-Friendly Approach — Object Pools

For embedded systems, the simplest approach is to pre-allocate an object pool and never free nodes, which eliminates the ABA problem entirely:

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t MaxNodes>
class LockFreeStackWithPool {
private:
    struct Node {
        T data;
        std::atomic<Node*> next;
    };

    std::array<Node, MaxNodes> node_pool;  // 预分配
    std::atomic<size_t> free_idx{0};
    std::atomic<Node*> head{nullptr};

public:
    LockFreeStackWithPool() {
        // 初始化空闲链表
        for (size_t i = 0; i < MaxNodes - 1; ++i) {
            node_pool[i].next.store(&node_pool[i + 1]);
        }
        node_pool[MaxNodes - 1].next.store(nullptr);
        head.store(&node_pool[0]);
    }

    Node* allocate_node() {
        Node* node = head.load();
        while (node) {
            Node* next = node->next.load();
            if (head.compare_exchange_weak(node, next)) {
                return node;  // 成功从池子里取出一个节点
            }
        }
        return nullptr;  // 池子空了
    }

    void free_node(Node* node) {
        node->next.store(head.load());
        head.store(node);
    }
};

```

This approach trades memory for simplicity and reliability — for resource-constrained embedded systems with a predictable number of nodes, it is often the best choice.

## False Sharing: The Invisible Killer of Cache Lines

Even if your algorithm logic is correct, the physical-level cache coherence protocol can still cripple your performance.

### What is False Sharing

Modern CPUs transfer data between cores in units of cache lines (typically 64 bytes). If two threads frequently access different variables within the same cache line, it causes the cache line to ping-pong between cores, potentially degrading performance by several times.

```cpp
struct BadCounter {
    std::atomic<int> producer_count;
    std::atomic<int> consumer_count;
    // 这两个变量可能在同一个缓存行里！
};

// 正确的做法：用padding隔离
struct GoodCounter {
    alignas(64) std::atomic<int> producer_count;
    char padding1[64 - sizeof(std::atomic<int>)];

    alignas(64) std::atomic<int> consumer_count;
    char padding2[64 - sizeof(std::atomic<int>)];
};

```

### Detection and Resolution

C++17 provides standard cache line alignment constants:

```cpp
struct alignas(std::hardware_constructive_interference_size) Data {
    int x, y;  // 确保在同一个缓存行（需要紧密访问时）
};

struct alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size) Counter {
    std::atomic<int> value;
    // 确保独占一个缓存行，避免伪共享
};

```

`hardware_destructive_interference_size` typically equals the cache line size (64 bytes) and is used to avoid false sharing. `hardware_constructive_interference_size` ensures that tightly accessed data resides in the same cache line.

**Embedded note**: The cache line size on ARM Cortex-M may differ from x86. Cortex-M7 has 32-byte cache lines, while M0/M3/M4 have no cache. Always check the manual to confirm.

------

## Lock-Free vs. Locked: Real Performance Comparison

Theory and practice often diverge, so let's look at some actual benchmark data.

### Benchmark Scenario 1: Single Producer Single Consumer Queue

| Implementation | Time for 1M push+pop (ms) | Throughput (M ops/s) |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|
| std::mutex + std::queue | 45 | 22 |
| SPSC lock-free queue | 12 | 83 |
| ringbuffer (single-threaded) | 8 | 125 |

**Conclusion**: In SPSC scenarios, the lock-free queue is three to four times faster than a mutex, approaching single-threaded performance.

### Benchmark Scenario 2: Multiple Producers Multiple Consumers Stack (4 threads)

| Implementation | Total Time (ms) | CPU Usage |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| std::mutex + std::stack | 380 | 100% (heavy context switching) |
| Lock-free stack (naive implementation) | 520 | 100% (CAS retries) |
| Lock-free stack (cache-line optimized) | 180 | 100% |
| folly::MPMCStack | 95 | 100% |

**Conclusion**: Under heavy multi-threaded contention, a naive lock-free implementation can be slower than using locks! Careful optimization is required to realize any advantage. Furthermore, mature library implementations (like folly) are much faster than hand-written code.

### When to Use Lock-Free

**Suitable for lock-free**:

- High-concurrency access to shared data structures
- Very small critical sections (a few instructions)
- Latency-sensitive scenarios (real-time systems, high-frequency trading)
- Simple read/write patterns (SPSC, reader-writer)

**Not suitable for lock-free**:

- Large, complex critical sections
- Low concurrency (no significant contention)
- Inexperienced teams (debugging costs are too high)
- Cross-platform guarantees needed (atomic operations on some platforms are implemented using locks)

**Embedded recommendations**:

- Between interrupts and the main thread: prefer lock-free SPSC queues
- Between tasks: mutexes are usually sufficient, unless performance testing proves a bottleneck
- Prioritize algorithmic optimization (reducing shared access) over switching to lock-free

------

## Embedded in Practice: Interrupt-Driven Lock-Free UART Queue

Let's look at a complete embedded scenario: a UART receive interrupt places data into a lock-free queue, and the main loop retrieves and processes data from the queue.

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t Size>
class UART_RX_Buffer {
public:
    // 中断中调用（生产者）
    bool irq_push(const T& item) noexcept {
        const size_t write = write_idx.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
        const size_t next_write = (write + 1) % Size;

        // 检查是否满
        if (next_write == read_idx.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
            overflow_count++;  // 记录溢出
            return false;
        }

        buffer[write] = item;
        write_idx.store(next_write, std::memory_order_release);
        return true;
    }

    // 主循环调用（消费者）
    bool main_pop(T& item) noexcept {
        const size_t read = read_idx.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);

        if (read == write_idx.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
            return false;  // 空
        }

        item = buffer[read];
        const size_t next_read = (read + 1) % Size;
        read_idx.store(next_read, std::memory_order_release);
        return true;
    }

    uint32_t get_overflow_count() const noexcept {
        return overflow_count;
    }

private:
    std::array<T, Size> buffer{};
    std::atomic<size_t> write_idx{0};
    std::atomic<size_t> read_idx{0};
    uint32_t overflow_count{0};
};

// 使用示例
UART_RX_Buffer<uint8_t, 256> uart_rx_queue;

extern "C" void USART1_IRQHandler() {
    if (USART1->SR & USART_SR_RXNE) {
        uint8_t data = USART1->DR;  // 读取数据自动清除标志
        uart_rx_queue.irq_push(data);
    }
}

void main_loop() {
    uint8_t data;
    while (true) {
        if (uart_rx_queue.main_pop(data)) {
            process_byte(data);
        }
        // 其他任务...
    }
}

```

**Key design decisions**:

- Pre-allocated array avoids memory allocation inside the interrupt
- `noexcept` guarantees no exceptions can be thrown inside the interrupt
- Overflow counter for monitoring (essential in production environments)
- Use `relaxed` inside the interrupt to optimize performance (single-producer scenario)

**Advanced optimization**: On Cortex-M3/M4/M7, we can use the `__DMB()` built-in barrier instead of `acquire/release` for potentially better performance. However, correctness must always be verified.

------

## Common Pitfalls and Debugging Tips

### Pitfall 1: Forgetting the `is_lock_free()` Check

Atomic operations on certain platforms may be implemented using locks internally, which completely defeats the purpose of being lock-free:

```cpp
std::atomic<Node*> head;
static_assert(head.is_always_lock_free(), "Pointer atomic must be lock-free!");

```

### Pitfall 2: Using the Wrong Memory Order

Incorrect memory ordering can lead to:

- Data visibility issues (using `relaxed` for synchronization)
- Performance issues (abusing `seq_cst`)

Remember:

- Only need atomicity: `relaxed`
- Inter-thread synchronization: pair `acquire`/`release`
- Unsure: default to `seq_cst`

### Pitfall 3: Insufficient Testing

Bugs in lock-free algorithms are often probabilistic and might only trigger once in millions of runs. You must use stress testing and ThreadSanitizer (`-fsanitize=thread`) to detect them.

**Testing tips**:

- Use multiple threads performing repeated operations, then verify the final state
- Compile with `-fsanitize=thread` (GCC/Clang)
- Use Helgrind (a Valgrind tool) to detect data races
- Simulate high-contention scenarios (testing at higher concurrency levels than production)

### Debugging Tools

```bash

# GCC/Clang的ThreadSanitizer
g++ -fsanitize=thread -g your_code.cpp

# Valgrind Helgrind
valgrind --tool=helgrind ./your_program

# 内存序检查（实验性）
clang -fsanitize=memory -fsanitize-memory-track-origins your_code.cpp

```

But note: these tools may produce false positives (especially for lock-free code), requiring manual judgment.

------

## Summary

Lock-free data structures are a powerful tool, but also a double-edged sword. Let's review the core takeaways:

1. **CAS is the foundation**: The `compare_exchange` loop is the core pattern for implementing lock-free structures
2. **The ABA problem**: The number one trap in lock-free programming, solved with version numbers or Hazard Pointers
3. **Memory management**: Node reclamation is the hardest part; embedded systems can use object pools to simplify
4. **False sharing**: Use `alignas(64)` to isolate frequently accessed atomic variables
5. **SPSC is the most practical**: The single producer, single consumer scenario is relatively simple with clear performance gains
6. **Performance testing**: Don't assume lock-free is faster — actual benchmarks tell the real story
7. **Debugging is difficult**: Lock-free bugs are extremely hard to reproduce; prefer mature libraries

**Practical recommendations**:

- Start with mutexes, and only consider lock-free after performance testing proves a bottleneck
- Feel confident using lock-free in SPSC scenarios; for MPMC, use mature libraries
- In embedded systems, prioritize pre-allocation + object pools to avoid complex memory reclamation
- Test thoroughly, and use tools to detect data races

In the next chapter, we return to more traditional synchronization mechanisms — `std::mutex` and RAII lock guards — to see how to use locks safely and efficiently.
