# Prerequisites for OnceCallback (Part 1): Function Types and Template Partial Specialization

## Introduction

If this is your first time seeing the `OnceCallback<int(int, int)>` syntax, you'll probably find it a bit odd—`int(int, int)` looks like a function declaration, but it appears in a template parameter position. What exactly is this? How does the compiler break `int(int, int)` down into information like "returns int, takes two int parameters"?

In this post, we'll break down this seemingly bizarre but actually elegant technique. Once you understand it, you'll be able to see why the template signatures of `std::function`, `std::move_only_function`, and our `OnceCallback` look the way they do.

## Function Types: An Easily Overlooked Type in C++

Let's start with a fundamental question: Is `int(int, int)` a type in C++?

The answer is yes. `int(int, int)` is something called a **function type**, which describes "a function that takes two int parameters and returns an int." Note that it is not a function pointer `int(*)(int, int)`, nor a function reference `int(&)(int, int)`—a function type is a more low-level concept than a function pointer.

We can verify this with `typeid`:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

static_assert(std::is_function_v<int(int, int)>);           // 通过：是函数类型
static_assert(!std::is_pointer_v<int(int, int)>);           // 通过：不是指针
static_assert(std::is_pointer_v<int(*)(int, int)>);         // 通过：这是函数指针
```

Function types appear in actual code more often than you might think. When you write a function declaration:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b);
```

The type of `add` is `int(int, int)`. You can think of it as a "signature"—it fully describes what parameters the function accepts and what type it returns, without involving where the function itself is stored.

There is an implicit conversion between function types and function pointers: in most expressions, a function name automatically decays into a pointer to itself. This is just like an array name decaying into a pointer—`arr` in `int arr[5]` becomes `int*` in most contexts, and `add` in `int add(int, int)` becomes `int(*)(int, int)`.

However, when passed as a **template argument**, the function type does not decay—the compiler receives the type exactly as-is. This is the very prerequisite that allows us to decompose it using template partial specialization.

## Primary Template + Partial Specialization: The Pattern for Decomposing Function Types

Now let's look at how `OnceCallback`'s template declaration is written. It uses a two-step design: first, it declares a primary template that accepts only one type parameter, and then it provides a partially specialized version for the case where "that type parameter happens to be a function type."

### Step 1: Primary Template Declaration

```cpp
template<typename FuncSignature>
class OnceCallback;  // 主模板：只有声明，没有定义
```

The primary template intentionally provides no implementation. This isn't an oversight, but a design choice—if someone accidentally writes a usage like `OnceCallback<int>` (passing a plain int type instead of a function signature), the compiler will error during template instantiation because it can't find a definition. This is a compile-time safety net.

### Step 2: Partial Specialization Version

```cpp
template<typename ReturnType, typename... FuncArgs>
class OnceCallback<ReturnType(FuncArgs...)> {
    // 所有真正的代码都在这里
};
```

The template parameter list of this partial specialization is `<typename ReturnType, typename... FuncArgs>`, and the `OnceCallback<ReturnType(FuncArgs...)>` following the class name is the **pattern matching condition** for the partial specialization—it says: "When `FuncSignature` can be decomposed into the form `ReturnType(FuncArgs...)`, use this version."

### The Compiler's Matching Process

When you write `OnceCallback<int(int, int)>`, the compiler does the following:

First, it sees you are instantiating `OnceCallback` with the template argument `int(int, int)`. Then it looks at the primary template `template<typename FuncSignature> class OnceCallback` and binds `FuncSignature` to the overall type `int(int, int)`. Next, it checks whether a partial specialization can be used—the partial specialization requires `FuncSignature` to match the pattern `ReturnType(FuncArgs...)`. `int(int, int)` can be exactly decomposed into `ReturnType = int` and `FuncArgs = {int, int}`, so the match succeeds! The partial specialization version is selected.

You can think of this process as a type-level pattern matching—just as the regular expression `(\w+)\((\w+(?:,\s*\w+)*)\)` can extract the return value and parameter list from the string `int(int, int)`, template partial specialization extracts the return type and parameter pack from the type `int(int, int)`.

### It Uses the Exact Same Technique as `std::function`

If you look at the standard library implementation of `std::function`, you'll find it uses the exact same pattern:

```cpp
// std::function 的简化实现
template<typename> class function; // 主模板

template<typename R, typename... Args>
class function<R(Args...)> {        // 偏特化
    // ...
};
```

`std::move_only_function` (C++23) is the same. This "primary template + function type partial specialization" pattern appears three times in the standard library, making it a thoroughly validated design.

---

## Hands-on Practice: Implementing a FuncTraits

Reading without practicing is easy to forget. Let's implement a minimal function signature decomposition tool ourselves to solidify our understanding. The goal is: given a function type `R(Args...)`, we can extract the return type `R` and the parameter pack `Args...`.

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

// 主模板：对非函数类型不提供定义
template<typename T>
struct FuncTraits;

// 偏特化：拆解函数类型 R(Args...)
template<typename R, typename... Args>
struct FuncTraits<R(Args...)> {
    using ReturnType = R;
    using ArgsTuple = std::tuple<Args...>;

    static constexpr std::size_t kArity = sizeof...(Args);
};

// 验证
static_assert(std::is_same_v<FuncTraits<int(double, char)>::ReturnType, int>);
static_assert(std::is_same_v<FuncTraits<void()>::ReturnType, void>);
static_assert(FuncTraits<int(int, int, int)>::kArity == 3);
```

`FuncTraits` and `OnceCallback` use the exact same partial specialization pattern. The only difference is that `FuncTraits` stores the decomposed types as a `using` alias and a `static constexpr` constant, while `OnceCallback` directly uses these types inside the partially specialized class to define data members and methods.

Try compiling and running this example—if all the `static_assert` pass (with no compilation errors), it means the partial specialization correctly decomposed the function type. You can try adding some more complex types to test:

```cpp
// 更复杂的验证
static_assert(std::is_same_v<
    FuncTraits<std::string(const std::string&, int)>::ReturnType,
    std::string>);
static_assert(std::is_same_v<
    FuncTraits<void(int&&)>::ArgsTuple,
    std::tuple<int&&>>);
```

---

## Why Not Use OnceCallback<R, Args...>?

You might wonder: since the goal is to get the return type and parameter list, why not just write it in the form `OnceCallback<R, Args...>`? Like this:

```cpp
template<typename R, typename... Args>
class OnceCallback {
    // ...
};

// 使用：OnceCallback<int, int, int> cb([](int a, int b) { return a + b; });
```

This approach is technically feasible, but the user experience takes a hit. Compare the two ways of calling it:

```cpp
// 签名式：一个模板参数，看起来像函数签名
OnceCallback<int(int, int)> cb1([](int a, int b) { return a + b; });

// 参数罗列式：返回类型和参数分开写
OnceCallback<int, int, int> cb2([](int a, int b) { return a + b; });
```

The first one is more natural—`int(int, int)` is a complete function signature, and it's clear at a glance. The second requires you to mentally interpret the first `int` as the return type and the subsequent `int, int` as the parameter list, which adds cognitive overhead. The standard library also chose the signature style—`std::function<int(int, int)>` rather than `std::function<int, int, int>`.

The signature style has another subtle benefit: it's more consistent with C++'s type system. `int(int, int)` is a real type, whereas "a return type plus a set of parameter types" is not a type—it's just a listing of several types. Using a function type as a template parameter operates at the level of the type system, rather than at the level of syntactic sugar.

Of course, the signature style also has a drawback—the compiler cannot automatically deduce the complete signature from a callable object. This is why the first template parameter `Signature` of `bind_once` must be manually specified. We'll discuss this trade-off in detail in the upcoming `bind_once` implementation post.

## Summary

In this post, we clarified three things. A function type `int(int, int)` is a valid type in C++ that fully describes a function's signature; it is neither a function pointer nor a function reference. The "primary template + partial specialization" pattern decomposes a function type into a return type and a parameter pack through pattern matching, and `std::function`, `std::move_only_function`, and our `OnceCallback` all use the same technique. The signature style `OnceCallback<R(Args...)>` is more natural and better aligns with the design philosophy of the C++ type system than the parameter-listing style `OnceCallback<R, Args...>`.

In the next post, we'll look at `std::invoke`—the key tool that enables `bind_once` to uniformly handle function pointers, member function pointers, and lambdas.
