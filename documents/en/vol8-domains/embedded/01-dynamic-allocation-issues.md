# The Cost of Dynamic Memory: Fragmentation and Non-Determinism (Memory Layout, Fragmentation, and Memory Alignment)

## Introduction

In embedded systems, dynamic memory seems convenient, but its costs are often underestimated—fragmentation, timing non-determinism, and issues with alignment and structure padding can quietly consume resources and reliability.

As we all know, embedded environments have extremely limited resources, and minor memory allocation decisions can affect stability, real-time performance, and power consumption. Understanding the cost of dynamic memory helps us avoid catastrophic design errors—or at least minimize the risks when dynamic memory is unavoidable.

## A Quick Review of Memory Layout: Static, Heap, and Stack

Before we begin, let's review the core concepts:

- **Static area (.data/.bss/.rodata)**: Sizes are determined at compile time or link time; holds global variables, constants, and read-only data. Their lifetime matches that of the program, the risk of fragmentation is nearly zero, but flexibility is low.
- **Stack**: Holds local variables and automatic objects for function calls. Allocation/deallocation is extremely fast (usually just pointer increments/decrements), highly structured, and lifetimes are controlled by scope. The downsides are limited capacity, inability to share across tasks, and unsuitability for large objects or objects with variable lifetimes.
- **Heap**: Dynamically allocated at runtime (`malloc` / `new` / `operator new`, etc.). Flexible but with obvious costs: allocation and deallocation times are non-deterministic, it generates fragmentation, and the memory layout is non-linear.

In embedded development, the general order of preference is: stack (if size permits) → static (pre-allocated) → heap (use cautiously, ideally controlled).

## Fragmentation: What, Why, and How It Affects the System

### Internal Fragmentation

When an allocator allocates a larger block than actually requested to satisfy alignment or minimum allocation unit requirements, this unused space is **internal fragmentation**. Examples:

- If an allocator allocates in 16-byte granularity, a 20-byte object will occupy 32 bytes (16×2), and the extra 12 bytes become internal fragmentation.
- Frequent allocation of small objects with a large allocation unit leads to decreased memory utilization.

### External Fragmentation

The heap contains many free blocks, but these blocks are scattered and non-contiguous, making it impossible to merge them into a large enough contiguous space to satisfy a larger allocation request. The result can be a situation where the total memory is sufficient, but allocation still fails ("usable memory fragmentation"). What we observe is—

- As runtime increases, available large blocks of memory decrease, leading to occasional `new`/`malloc` failures.
- The system exhibits intermittent crashes, memory leak-like symptoms, and degraded stability after long-term operation.
- Real-time tasks experience long-tail latency (sporadic long allocation/deallocation operations).

## Alignment and Padding

### Why Alignment Is Needed

CPUs typically expect certain data to be aligned to its natural boundary (for example, 4-byte alignment, 8-byte alignment); otherwise, access becomes slower or triggers hardware exceptions on some architectures. Alignment also affects DMA, peripheral access, and cache coherency.

### Structure Padding Example

```cpp
// 假设：sizeof(char)=1, sizeof(int32_t)=4
struct A {
    char c;      // offset 0
    int32_t x;   // 如果按照 4 字节对齐，x 的 offset 通常是 4
};              // sizeof(A) 通常是 8（包括 3 字节填充）

```

`char` takes 1 byte, `int32_t` requires 4-byte alignment, so the compiler inserts 3 bytes of padding after `c`, aligning the total struct size to a multiple of 4 (which is 8 here).

Placing members with larger alignment requirements first can reduce padding:

```cpp
struct B {
    int32_t x;
    char c;
}; // sizeof(B) 通常是 8，但如果有更多小成员，将更紧凑

```

Alternatively, we can use `#pragma pack` or `__attribute__((packed))` to forcibly remove padding, but note:

- After removing padding, reading unaligned members can cause severe performance degradation or hardware exceptions on certain architectures.
- Only use this when the consequences are fully understood and it is strictly necessary to save space.

#### Relationship with DMA / Cachelines

- DMA requires buffers to be aligned to peripheral requirements (for example, 32 bytes). Misalignment can cause hardware rejection or severe performance degradation.
- Aligning to a cacheline (typically 32/64 bytes) helps avoid false sharing and cache thrashing, which is especially important in multi-core environments or when concurrently accessing memory with DMA.

## The Non-Determinism of Dynamic Memory: Time and Repeatability Issues

- **Non-deterministic allocation/deallocation time**: General-purpose heap implementations rely on complex data structures (free lists, trees, bitmaps), making the execution time of `malloc`/`free` unpredictable, potentially with long-tail latency.
- **Concurrency and lock contention**: In multi-threaded environments, the heap usually requires locks or thread-local caches (TLC); lock contention impacts real-time performance.
- **Irrecoverable fragmentation**: For standard C/C++ heaps, once fragmentation forms, it is difficult to recover in linear time. It must be resolved by restarting or using specialized compaction strategies (which are usually impractical).

Embedded systems are particularly sensitive to this: long-tail latency can lead to dropped frames, control timeouts, or safety issues.

------

## Common Embedded Alternatives and Hybrid Strategies

So what do we do? Let's quickly go over a few common strategies:

#### Memory Pool / Slab

- Divides memory into fixed-size blocks (for example, 32B, 64B, 256B). Allocation returns a block index or pointer, and deallocation returns the block to a free linked list.
- Pros: Allocation/deallocation in constant time (O(1)), no external fragmentation (as long as all object sizes match a specific pool).
- Cons: Requires multiple pools for different sized objects, memory utilization depends on allocation granularity, and it generates internal fragmentation.

#### Bump / Arena Allocator (Linear Allocator)

- Allocates linearly from a contiguous buffer; deallocation is usually all-at-once (resetting the entire arena).
- Extremely fast with no fragmentation; suitable for objects with consistent lifetimes (for example, temporary objects during a single task or initialization phase).
- Not suitable for objects that require arbitrary deallocation.

#### Slab Allocation (Linux Style)

- Suitable for caching identical types of objects (kernel objects); can reuse initialized objects upon deallocation, reducing construction/destruction overhead.

#### Object Pool + RAII (C++ Style)

- Combines a memory pool with `std::unique_ptr<T, Deleter>` or custom smart pointers to guarantee exception safety and automatic deallocation.
